So you hate doing the same form stuff over and over and over, and just for good measure over again? Well, so do I.

formsSuck is a benevolent dictator of a form script. It likes jQuery, jQuery.tmpl, jQuery.ujs, jQuery.labelify,
jQuery.validator and jQuery.password123. It'll take your forms and turn them into loving fan boys of a specific yet modular
way of doing forms and it'll eliminate those 50-60 lines of code you've to craft for every damn form and shorten it to just
a few lines.

Ultimately it's a timesaver and not much more. Think of it as the lazy hacker tool for forms. Why use formsSucks? Because
forms suck and you deserve to just a little less angry. You deserve it man, treat yourself.                    

Docs forthcoming, maybe. I've software to cuss at and code to break.
